# AboveTheClouds-code-samples
A few code samples from what I worked on for my Capstone Project at Ohio State.

Includes:

    -code I wrote for managing our enemy-camera-targeting system, similar to Zelda's z-targeting.

    -the game's State Machine, a singleton that manages the game's state, such as pause, loading, running, etc.

    -a couple simple classes to handle unique features for our game, such as the Healing Pool and the Dissolve effect
